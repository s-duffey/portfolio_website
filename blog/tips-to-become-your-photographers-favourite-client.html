                                Like all freelancers I’ve had clients that I loved to work with and others that I didn’t. It’s taken time,
                                but eventually I started to notice patterns among all of the clients that really had the most creative and
                                fun photo sessions with some of the best images as a result.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Photography is a service and a product, but more importantly, it’s an experience that is created by both
                                the photographer and the client. By working collaboratively and effectively communicating the overall
                                vision of a session, both you and your photographer will come out better as a result.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Here are some of my top tips for becoming your photographer’s favourite client, and preparing for an
                                amazing photography experience:
                            </p>

                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-lg-7">
                                    <h2>
                                        Hire your photographer because you like their style and because you trust them.
                                    </h2>

                                    <p>
                                        The very best thing you can do to work with a photographer is to hire them because of their style!
                                        When you resonate with a photographer’s style and personality the session is more likely to turn out
                                        the way you want and become a fun experience for you!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As a creative, I love it when you trust me to do my best work. The discovery meeting is an important
                                        time for us to talk about your must-have shots, and the end goal for the session. Having a sense of
                                        what images you need, and what you’re going to use them for is important, but there’s no need for you
                                        to create a detailed shot list. It’s my job to figure out your vision, work with you during the
                                        photoshoot, and create something that you will love. Trust the process and that trust will go a long
                                        way into making the session a memorable and delightful experience.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2> Ask questions about the process and the final results rather than the price </h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Pricing is always a tricky art and science for photographers. It’s hard to put a price on a unique end
                                        product and experience. While your budget is always an important factor - personal photography is
                                        usually a higher-end, once-in-a-while purchase. A good photographer is truly an investment when
                                        creating images that will tell your story or capture important memories. Shopping around based on
                                        price is bound to leave you disappointed, since the budget option often lacks the personalization and
                                        artistry that a professional photographer will get you.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                Along the way, I’ll always answer questions about price, but if you ask me about my process or the final
                                images we’ll be creating together, you’ll get a much more detailed answer. I became a photographer because
                                I love the process that goes into every session - from the initial discovery chat, to setting up the
                                lighting, finessing you into natural poses, to editing and tweaking the digitals.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Understanding the value of what you’re getting, and how we are going to work together to get there will be
                                a much more fulsome conversation than one based on price. Think of your photographer as a partner in
                                creating some art - the process is what’s most important and what will get you the end result you’re
                                looking for!
                            </p>
                            <h2> Bring a mood board or some visual references to your discovery meeting </h2>
                            <p>
                                Mood boards are an amazing way to plan for your photo session. You don’t necessarily have to be a design
                                guru to create a brilliant mood board. Just putting some of your thoughts onto paper or in a digital
                                format will go a long way when working with me in the planning stages. You don’t need to worry too much
                                about exact shots or poses, but think more about the general concepts like the environment, the mood and
                                the colour scheme.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Photographers are visual so any visual medium to showcase your thinking and inspiration will really help
                                articulate your style and ideas for your session. Pinterest boards or Instagram collections are a great
                                place to save images that speak to you. Simple paper sketches (with pencil crayons or markers!) are great
                                too. During your discovery meeting, we will chat about the kinds of colours, moods and props that will
                                bring your images to life. Having some photos or colours to reference will get the wheels turning in my
                                head to create a unique session for you!

                            <h2> Think about what you want to do with your final images </h2>
                            <p>
                                Before your discovery meeting, put a bit of thought into how you are going to use your final images. Are
                                they for your website, social media accounts, to put on your wall? Having an idea ahead of time will help
                                me plan our shoot and make sure we capture images that serve that purpose.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whether your photos are used on a screen or for print will make a big difference in how we set up the
                                lighting, props and the general frame of each image. If you’re planning on using photos for both - cool! -
                                knowing in advance will help me create a more realistic timeline. Based on their final use - images will
                                also have a much different editing process to make sure the digital file works best for its final output.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Overall, the goal of your photoshoot is to get images that you will actually download and use - so lets
                                make sure they look their best wherever they end up!
                            </p>

                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-lg-5 align-self-center order-lg-1 order-xl-1 order-md-12 order-sm-12 order-last">

                                    <h2> Choose a location you are comfortable with and clothes that make you feel confident </h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Confidence really translates into the camera, so being comfortable is just as important as looking
                                        fabulous on session day! Start by choosing a shoot location that you will be comfortable in - an
                                        environment that you already know well and spend lots of time at. If your session is in the studio,
                                        let your photographer know your favourite drink, what kind of music you like, and anything else you
                                        need to feel like your complete self. When you’re comfortable, we’ll both have a great time - and
                                        those smiles, laughter and genuine play will be captured through the lens.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Equally important is that you wear clothes that you look and feel great in. Sticking to your own style
                                        will ultimately lead to the best photos since you will be able to be yourself throughout the shoot.
                                        While you want to look your absolute best - choose clothing that really represents the best version of
                                        you and that matches the environment you’ll be photographed in. If your portrait session involves
                                        moving or stretching, be sure your clothes enable that.
                                    </p>

                                    <h2> Check-in and ask questions </h2>
                                    <p>
                                        If you aren’t sure about something, please ask! I pride myself on my excellent service and am always
                                        happy to answer questions. More likely than not, someone else has asked that question before and I
                                        probably already have the resources to help you.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Checking in is also great, especially if we’ve booked our session far in advance. Knowing how you’re
                                        feeling, that you’ve changed your mind on something, that you need to adjust your schedule - will all
                                        help ensure your day goes smoothly.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                Before the day of the session, I recommend that you look at my blog: Preparing for your perfect headshot.
                                A few tips and tricks may be all you need to finesse your look and get ready for shooting day.

                            <h2> Get ready to shoot </h2>
                            <p>
                                While there are so many versions of a successful photoshoot, these are just some of my best suggestions
                                for getting the most out of your own session. Photographers have our own styles and ways of working, but
                                we really just want to create a great image that you can’t wait to share. Being open to trying new things
                                and enjoying your day will shine through the lens and into your final images.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With these considerations in mind we can work together to craft an amazing experience as well as pixel
                                perfect images for wherever they end up. Get in touch to set up a session and create together!
