              <h2 class="mb-3">What is content design?</h2>
                <p>
                    Content design is a lot more than creating snazzy and beautiful content. It is the deliberate planning and strategy for creating content that aligns with your brand, has a specific purpose, and leads to conversions. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Working with a content designer will get you to think about your content differently to create content that is easy to manage and re-purpose. This will save you time in the long run and keep consistency across your customer experience. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Content design also includes setting explicit guidelines and standards so that you can create high-quality content every time you bring pen to paper.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Using the expert eye and knowledge of a content designer, you can make sure content is optimized for each platform, while maintaining flexibility. 
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">I’ve already posted a lot of content, why would I want to revisit it?</h2>
              <p>
                Good content:
              </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Aligns with your brand and story </li>
                    <li> Is consistent in tone and feel, across one piece as well as when put together into a collection </li>
                    <li> Has high-quality writing, imagery and presentation, as well as solid concepts and ideas. </li>
                    <li> Is easy to find, including optimizing for search engines (SEO)</li>
                    <li> Is accessible to diverse audiences with a wide range of abilities and understanding </li>
                    <li> Is easy to break down and repurpose into different pieces </li>
                    <li> Follows clients through a journey, inciting action at each step </li>
                    <li> Stands the test of time by being adaptable to different formats, platforms and new technologies. </li>
                    <li> Is clean and easy to manage, edit, code, publish and share </li>
                </ul>
                <p> 
                While it’s likely your content hits some of these areas, you can probably improve it to hit all of them!

              <h2 class="mb-3"> Why would I work with a content designer?</h2>
              <p>
               A content designer is an expert at breaking content down into its core elements to improve individual pieces of content (e.g. a blog post) and within the greater context of your full story. A content designer knows how to work with individual pieces to ensure quality, then works with these pieces to create groupings and a comprehensive story that hits the mark for clients at each step in their experience. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  Content designers also work with you as the business owner to set up a process to create content that is easy to maintain and build on in the future - saving you time and money while ensuring quality. 
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3"> What does working with you look like? </h2>
                <p> 
                    I have a unique blend of skills in writing, visual design, user experience research and web design. I use a multi-disciplinary approach to evaluate and improve content from all angles, including the visual appeal, writing quality, technical elements and how it fits into the whole story of your business. I’ve worked on creating tailored content for small audiences to large-scale information architecture projects for content-heavy government websites. I’ve mastered the art of zooming in to the details and zooming out to evaluate the bigger picture. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    When working with clients to improve overall content design, I draw from techniques in different fields. Some examples of this include looking at content in the context of a client’s journey map (user experience), testing for SEO and accessibility standards (programming), and using a critical visual eye (photography and design). 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I’m so inspired by business owners and content creators so my work is very collaborative, aiming to teach you a bit about my skills as we work through a project together. I’ll be working alone for some of the more tedious pieces (like a detailed content inventory) but will check in often and plan all sorts of activities for us to improve your content together. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    As a general overview of the steps we will take:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Create a detailed content inventory that documents all of your existing content pieces </li>
                    <li> Analyze how all your content works together, including how it fits in with your client’s overall experience of your business. </li>
                    <li> Document a process for managing and re-using your content efficiently, as well as a new folder structure and tool recommendations
                    </li>
                    <li> Edit and improve your existing content based on our analysis </li>
                    <li> Identify opportunities for new content </li>
                    <li> Perform website tests and identify improvements such as accessibility checks, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), plain language etc. </li>
                    <li> Create a personalized style guide for creating new content </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="mb-3"> Can you give me an example? </h2>
                <p> 
                    I think the best example I could give you would be for you to experience the benefits of content design yourself! Since we’ll be starting your project with pieces you’ve already created, it makes sense to try it out before we dig deep. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    That’s why I’ve created this handy content reflection worksheet. By working through this exercise, I hope to inspire you to start thinking about your content differently. This worksheet will give you a small sampling of the kind of detailed work we would do together to make your content more efficient and powerful. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Confirm your email to get a copy of the worksheet and start reflecting on one of your favourite pieces of content.

                <p> 
                    That’s cool too! I’m always open to hearing the awesome work of entrepreneurs in the community and would love to set up a coffee chat to talk about the projects you’re doing and new content you’re creating!
                </p>
                <p> 
                    All my coffee chats are free, with no pressure to set up a contract at the end. I like to start with a casual chat to collaborate and brainstorm together. My goal is to help you understand if a content design project might benefit you and your business.  If what I offer sounds like it would be helpful to you, I’ll give you all the details about initiating my content design services.
